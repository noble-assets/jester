# Jester

## Flags and Configuration

Users have three options to configure Jester:

- Flag - Use `--help` flag to see available flags for specific commands.
- ENV Variables - these must match either a config file setting OR a flag. Must be UPPERCASE. If a flag uses "-", the env variable equivalent is "_".
There is one unique environment variable of `JESTER_HOME` that mimics the  `--home` flag.
- Config file - (see: `jester config init`).

Note: configuration takes precedent this order (from top to bottom):

```text
Flag
ENV Variable
Conifg
```
